RULES AND REGULATIONS

We encourage you to use tools such as ChatGPT for help. It's a great way to be productive and learn something new. 
However, if you use these tools, please be mindful of a few EY risk and security protocols:

1. ABSOLUTELY no client data enters an AI tool
    - Client Name
    - Client sensitive information
    - Client data sent to EY 

2. No EY data enters an AI tool
    - EY name
    - EY sensitive information 
    - EY data 

3. No personal data enters an AI tool
    - Name, email, address 
    - Personally Identifiable Informaiton 

4. No refernece to Channel 1 clients 
    - Do not use examples from channel 1 clients 

5. To avoid risk, generalize any mock data for the purposes of your demo 
    - ie. if your use case is a product listing writer, your examples should just be "Shampoo" and not a specific brand's shampoo product 
    - Use publically avaible stock images
